### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Good to see you've found my account!
Here, you'll find all the latest projects that I'm working on.
Most of these aim to fuse hardware with software. Touching something you've coded gives me that magical feeling.

## For the flight sim enthusiasts:
- The Flightconnector Rust is the repo behind my MFS2020 connector.  It was initially made in C++ using the QT framework. I'm working on a new and improved version created in React and Rust (Tauri).
- The libraries reduce the time required for users to interface with the connector. Why reinvent the wheel when we've done the boring stuff? Both of these require some further optimizations to fit specific microprocessors better.
- The WASM module acts as a gateway to the deeper Gauge API of MFS2020.

## I'm working on:
- Porting over the C++ flightconnector to Rust.
